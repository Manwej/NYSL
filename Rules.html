              inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair
              play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or
              referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to
              disciplinary action regardless of technical soccer background,
              expertise, accomplishments or standing.

                      The decision for team/spectator placement on the field
                      will be made by the governing body of that team. A team’s
                      bench area shall consist of that area at least one (1)
                      yard away from the touchline and extending to twenty yards
                      (20) both ways from the halfway line. In the event that
                      field 1 EQUIPMENT conditions require team benches to be on
                      the same side of the field, a team’s bench area shall

                      touchline. Each team bench area shall be located two yards
                      outside the touchline, beginning not closer than five
                      yards from midfield and extending not further than twenty
                      yards from midfield. The home team shall have the right to
                      choose the location of its bench area. Coaches and

                      on the side of the midfield facing the team bench area of
                      that team. There shall be a buffer zone extending ten
                      yards on each side of the midfield that may not be

              play modified rules and size of roster as stated in United States
              Youth Soccer Association (USYSA) rules. It is strongly recommended
              that U-6 and U-8 play 4 v 4. UYSA shall not sanction games
              involving teams under 10 or younger unless such games are
              conducted with not more than eight (8) players per side. (National

            <li>
              Recreational/Developmental players at other ages or where numbers

              indicated below. A player who has been replaced may re-enter the
              game as a substitute at a later time.

            CONFISCATED PLAYER PASSES
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Passes of any individual(s) ejected from any match shall be
              retained after the match by the referee. The pass of any
              individual who has received a third caution (yellow card) during a
              playing year shall be confiscated by the referee at the conclusion
              of the match in which the third caution was received. That player
              will be suspended from playing in the next game in which the
              offending participant would otherwise be eligible to participate.
              This process will continue so that for every third yellow card
              received during a playing year, the player will be suspended from
              playing in the next game (after the receipt of a third yellow
              card) for which the offending participate would otherwise be
              eligible to participate. The referee shall deliver all confiscated
              passes to the UYSA State Office within forty-eight (48) hours of
              the conclusion of the match.

              All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall
              play at least fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the
              competition program are encouraged to play their players 50% of
              each game.
              <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                <li>
                  A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each
                  game under special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences
                  from practice and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice
                  and/or games, and injuries.

              Where the uniform colors of both teams are so similar that the

              on the part of the coaches, players or spectators of a team that
              is losing at the point that the game is terminated, shall stand as

              The referee shall verify the identity of the players and coaches

              Each team must determine whether or not referees are registered
              prior to the start of each game. Upon request, referees
              officiating at any game must willingly and without bias, show
              documentation regarding their certification level and registration
              standing with the USSF to coach, assistant coach, or team captain
              of teams participating in that game. Prior to the game a coach may
              decide to postpone the game if the referees do not produce the
              requested documentation. The game is to be replayed at a later
              date.
